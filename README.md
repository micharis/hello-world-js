## What is Devops According to you?

**Answer:**
Devops is not a tool. Devops is a culture of collaboration and communication between development team and  operational team, that helps SDLC process faster with automation and repeatable way.

## What is CI/CD and why is it important?

**Answer:**
CI/CD is a process in software development that introduces automation in the form of Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment. 

- CI in "CI/CD" refers to continuous integration which means the automation process of developers. This means that each application is often built, tested, and merged to a shared repository.

- CD in "CI/CD" refers to continuous delivery or continuous deployment. Both have the same goal of delivering applications to the production environment. Continuous delivery means the change from the developer to the application has automatically tested the bug and uploaded to the shared repository which will then be deployed by the operation team. Whereas Continuous deployment is a process that will help automate the deployment process carried out by the operation team.

- Why is it important? 
Every organization needs their application to be released to customers as often and as quickly as possible in order to compete in the market. Not only that, the quality of the application must also be considered. CI / CD is a solution to this, so it is important for companies to implement it.

## What are containers and how do they help in software development lifecycle and infrastructure management?

**Answer:**
Container is a mechanism or method of packaging an application and its dependencies, so that it can run quickly and be isolated from other computing processes. Application container offers portability, where we can run the application in various computing environments easily. 

For Software development, the container supports agile and DevOps efforts to accelerate development, test, and production cycles.

For Infrastructure management, container offers portability, consistency, and efficiency.
- Portability means applications running in containers can be deployed easily to multiple different operating systems and hardware platforms
- Consistency operations teams know applications in containers will run the same, regardless of where they are deployed.
- Efficiency containers require less system resources and allow applications to be more rapidly deployed, patched, or scaled.
